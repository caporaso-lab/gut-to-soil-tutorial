# The gut-to-soil axis microbiome analysis tutorial

:::{tip} Other resources are a better starting point for learning QIIME 2
:label: reference-to-amplicon-docs
If you're new to QIIME 2, the best place to get started is the QIIME 2 *amplicon distribution* documentation.
You can find that here: [](xref:amplicon-docs/).
Otherwise, read on...
:::

This site contains the [gut-to-soil axis](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2411.04148) microbiome analysis tutorial.
This is data-set-specific documentation.
At present, it presents an amplicon analysis tutorial but over time we expect this to grow and contain tutorials and other content that cross QIIME 2 distributions.
